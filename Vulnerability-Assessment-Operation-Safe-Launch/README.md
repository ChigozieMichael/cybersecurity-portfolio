# Operation Safe Launch – Security Assessment for Juiced Up

## Overview
This project documents an authorized multi-target security assessment conducted for Juiced Up as part of DELAP WARES INC’s internal cybersecurity engagement. The assessment covered a web application (Juice Shop), a vulnerable server (Metasploitable2), and an outdated workstation (Windows 7). Tools used included Nessus Essentials and OWASP ZAP, producing detailed vulnerability findings, proof-of-concept screenshots, and prioritized remediation steps.

## Consultant

## Assessment Window
Example scan run:  
2025-10-06 19:00 UTC → 2025-10-07 02:00 UTC  
All scans were performed during the agreed maintenance window.

## Scope of Targets
1. **Storefront Web Application – OWASP Juice Shop**  
2. **Back Office Server – Metasploitable2**  
3. **Marketing Workstation – Windows 7**

## Tools Used
- **Nessus Essentials** (network and host vulnerability scanning)  
- **OWASP ZAP** (web application security testing)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Executive Summary
The assessment exposed multiple critical and high-risk vulnerabilities across all targets, including:
- Full remote backdoors  
- SQL Injection  
- Web app misconfigurations  
- Unsupported operating systems  
- Outdated encryption protocols  
- Wormable exploit vectors (EternalBlue)

These vulnerabilities allow attackers to obtain remote access, exfiltrate data, escalate privileges, and move laterally within the network.

Immediate remediation is strongly recommended, especially isolating Windows 7, removing exploitable services from Metasploitable2, and patching web application components.

## Risk Rating Definitions
| Severity | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Critical | Immediate exploitation possible; total compromise likely |
| High | High probability of exploit; significant impact |
| Medium | Chained or conditional exploit scenarios |
| Low | Limited exploitability or impact |
| Info | Hygiene and informational findings |

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Storefront: OWASP Juice Shop (Web App)

#### SQL Injection – SQLite  
**Severity:** High  
**Evidence:** Appendix A (ZAP SQLi PoC)  
**Impact:**  
Attackers can manipulate queries, extract sensitive data, modify DB contents, and gain full database compromise.  
**Remediation:**  
- Server-side input validation  
- Parameterized queries / prepared statements  
- Principle of least privilege for DB accounts  
- WAF deployment for additional coverage  
- Re-scan after fixes

#### Cross-Domain JavaScript Source File Inclusion  
**Severity:** High  
**Evidence:** Appendix A  
**Impact:**  
If the third-party JS host is compromised, attackers can inject malicious scripts leading to account takeover, payment hijacking, or XSS.  
**Remediation:**  
- Add Subresource Integrity (SRI)  
- Restrict or harden CORS  
- Self-host sensitive JS  
- Monitor changes to third-party scripts

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Back Office: Metasploitable2

#### UnrealIRCd Backdoor  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Evidence:** Appendix B  
**Impact:**  
Provides attackers remote shell access, enabling full system compromise and lateral movement.  
**Remediation:**  
- Immediately isolate host  
- Remove or patch package  
- Assume compromise; perform forensic review  
- Reimage from secure baseline  
- Rotate exposed credentials

#### Apache Tomcat AJP Connector (Ghostcat – CVE-2020-1938)  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Evidence:** Appendix B  
**Impact:**  
Allows reading app files and potential remote code execution.  
**Remediation:**  
- Disable AJP if unnecessary  
- Patch Tomcat  
- Block port 8009 from untrusted networks

#### Weak/Obsolete SSL Protocols and Ciphers (SSLv2/SSLv3, RC4)  
**Severity:** High/Medium  
**Evidence:** Appendix B  
**Impact:**  
Vulnerable to cryptographic attacks such as DROWN, SWEET32, downgrade attacks.  
**Remediation:**  
- Disable SSLv2/SSLv3  
- Remove weak ciphers (RC4, DES, etc.)  
- Enforce TLS 1.2+  
- Replace weak certificates if present

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Marketing PC: Windows 7 Workstation

#### Unsupported Operating System  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Evidence:** Appendix C  
**Impact:**  
No security updates; numerous exploitable vulnerabilities; high-risk entry vector into internal network.  
**Remediation:**  
- Replace or upgrade to Windows 10/11  
- Isolate host  
- Apply compensating controls (segmentation, EDR)  
- Rebuild from secure image if required

#### MS17-010 (EternalBlue)  
**Severity:** High  
**Evidence:** Appendix C  
**Impact:**  
Allows remote code execution; wormable; enables rapid lateral movement.  
**Remediation:**  
- Apply MS17-010 patch  
- Disable SMBv1  
- Block SMB from untrusted networks  
- Verify via re-scan after remediation

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Recommendations & Remediation Roadmap

### Immediate (0–24 hours)
- Isolate Windows 7  
- Stop/remove exposed Metasploitable2 services  
- Block high-risk ports (8009, 5900, 6667, etc.)

### Short Term (1–7 days)
- Patch OS and critical applications  
- Change all default credentials  
- Disable SMBv1  
- Enforce TLS 1.2+  
- Harden and sanitize web app code

### Medium Term (2–4 weeks)
- Rebuild from secure baselines  
- Deploy EDR  
- Secure third-party JS integrations

### Long Term
- Implement formal patch management  
- Deploy WAF for storefront  
- Establish continuous scanning schedule  
- Maintain backups and IR plan
